    <h3>How to Prepare:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Place a medium pot over medium-high heat and add the butter. When the butter has started foaming, add the mushrooms, toss to coat and season with a large pinch of salt.</p>
            <p>Cook, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms have released all their liquid and are a deep mahogany brown, about 15 minutes.</p></li>
        <li>Add the onion, garlic and bay leaf and cook, stirring frequently, until onion and garlic are fragrant, softened and a little brown along the edges, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><p>Add the heavy cream, scraping off any stuck-on bits with a spatula or wooden spoon. Add the chicken, tomato purée, ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire sauce and a large pinch of salt.</p>
            <p>Stir to combine, bring to a gentle simmer and cook until flavors meld and chicken is fully cooked, about 10 minutes.</p></li>
        <li>Take the pan off the heat, remove and discard the bay leaf and stir in the parsley. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve on top of white rice and garnish with a handful of potato sticks.</li>
